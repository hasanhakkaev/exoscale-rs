## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**upper** | Option<**f64**> | Specify the upper occupancy limit of the allocated quota of memory for the shard. If the total memory usage of a shard is above this limit, shard indexing backpressure increases the current allocated memory for that shard. Default is 0.95 | [optional]
**optimal** | Option<**f64**> | Specify the optimal occupancy of the allocated quota of memory for the shard. If the total memory usage of a shard is at this level, shard indexing backpressure doesnâ€™t change the current allocated memory for that shard. Default is 0.85 | [optional]
**lower** | Option<**f64**> | Specify the lower occupancy limit of the allocated quota of memory for the shard. If the total memory usage of a shard is below this limit, shard indexing backpressure decreases the current allocated memory for that shard. Default is 0.75 | [optional]
